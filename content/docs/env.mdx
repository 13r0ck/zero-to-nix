Select your language below:

<Languages />

To get set up using Nix in your <Language /> project, create an empty project directory and add some
files to that directory using one of Determinate Systems' <Concept text="flake templates" id="flake-templates" />:

<Shell />

Now examine the contents of your directory:

```shell
ls .
```

What you should see:

```shell
flake.lock flake.nix
```

Let's go over what those files do

- The [`flake.lock`][flake.lock] file <Concept text="pins" id="pinning" /> all of your Nix
  dependencies to specific [Git revisions][rev].
- The [`flake.nix`][flake.nix] file defines the Nix <Concept id="flake-inputs" /> that your
  configuration requires as well as the <Concept id="flake-outputs" />&mdash;development
  environments, packages, [NixOS] configurations, and more&mdash;that you want your Nix code to
  produce.
