Harmonic differs from the [official Nix installer][official] in two important ways:

1. It installs Nix with [flakes] and the `nix-command` feature already enabled rather than requiring users to enable those features.
1. It stores a **receipt** for the install process in the [Nix store][store] at `/nix/receipt.json`. This receipt enables Harmonic to seamlessly uninstall Nix, whereas the official Nix installer doesn't provide any kind of offboarding path.
