We wrote this [Zero to Nix][z2n] breeze with one specific audience in mind: people who have heard about [Nix] but don't yet know much about it and aren't quite sure where to start with the learning process.
In this one-page guide, we'll [install Nix](#up) and use it to do some things that people often do with Nix, such as [running a program](#run) without needing to install it, using a [Nix development environment](#develop), [building](#build) a Nix [package]

If you're intrigued and would like to go further, check out the [quick start][start].

## Get Nix running \{#up}

First, install [Nix] using [Nix Installer][installer], an unofficial and experimental Nix installer from [Determinate Systems][ds]:

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
```

Nix Installer supports these platforms:

* Multi-user Linux with [systemd] init on 64-bit ARM and 64-bit AMD/Intel (no [SELinux])
* Multi-user macOS on 64-bit ARM and 64-bit AMD/Intel
* [Valve Steam Deck][steamdeck]

## Run

```shell
echo "Hello Nix" | nix run "nixpkgs#ponysay"
```

```shell
echo "# Hello" > hello.md
nix run "nixpkgs#bat" -- hello.md
rm hello.md
```

## Develop

```shell
nix develop "github:DeterminateSystems/zero-to-nix#example"
```

## Build

```shell
nix build "nixpkgs#bat"
```

## Install

```shell
nix profile install "nixpkgs#ponysay"
```

```shell
echo "Hello Nix" | ponysay
```

## Uninstall Nix \{#uninstall}

While we'd love for you to keep using Nix, you can uninstall it at any time if you need to:

```shell
/nix/nix-installer uninstall
```

The ability to seamlessly uninstall Nix from your system is one of the differentiating features of the [Determinate Nix Installer][dni].
If you install Nix using the [official installer][official], by contrast, you'd need to uninstall Nix manually.
