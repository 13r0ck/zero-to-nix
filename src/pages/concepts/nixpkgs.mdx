*Nixpkgs* (pronounced "Nix packages") is a big collection of [Nix] expressions, packages (who'd have thought...), and build utilities for the Nix ecosystem.
It is sometimes also called a "Nix standard library" (or Nix stdlib).

Nixpkgs is a mono repo, containing over 80,000 package definitions and the utilities to maintain this set of packages.
It also contains [NixOS](/concepts/nixos) modules and anything required to build and deploy a full Nix system.
Many tools in the Nix ecosystem depend on this standard library to function.

## Overlays

```nix
let renameOverlay = self: super: {
  booper = self.python3;
  bopper = self.curl;
};
```

```nix
{
  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, flake-utils }:
    let
      overlays = [
        (self: super: {
          # Modify Nixpkgs as `self` here
        })
      ];
    in flake-utils.lib.eachDefaultSystem (system: let
      pkgs = import nixpkgs { inherit overlays system; };
    in {
      devShells.default = pkgs.mkShell {
        packages = with pkgs; [ curl git jq wget ];
      };
    });
}
```

<Admonition success open title="Mental model" client:load>
It may be helpful to think of an overlay as a function that transforms an attribute set that's almost what you want into an attribute set that's exactly what you want.
