*Hermeticity* is a property of Nix builds which are isolated from the host system via various mechanisms.
This results in a system where the same set of source inputs will always map to the same build outputs,
because changes on the host can not affect a build.

There are some special parts in Nix that are _not_ hermetic.
These are referred to as "impure".
