In Nix a *derivation* is a set of instructions for building a [package](/concepts/package).
Each derivation can have dependencies onto other derivations, and produce one or more final outputs.
The most common outputs are
`out` (the most generic one),
`lib` (for library outputs),
`dev` (development resources such as header files),
and `man` (for manual pages).

A derivation and all of the dependencies required to build it
(direct dependencies, and all dependencies of those dependencies, etc) is called a *package closure*.
