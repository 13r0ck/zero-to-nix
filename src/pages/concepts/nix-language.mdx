*Nix* is a pure, functional, and reproducible programming language that powers the Nix packaging system.
To understand how Nix does what it does, it can be helpful to understand what these terms mean in detail.

| Concept                                   | Description                                                                                                                                     |
|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Declarative](/concepts/declarative)      | Describing a system outcome, instead of instructing the computer _how_ to achieve the outcome                                                   |
| [Reproducible](/concepts/reproducibility) | An operation that is performed twice yields the same result.  The same inputs map to the same outputs                                           |
| Functional                                | A programming-language design concept by which _functions_ can be passed as function arguments, and returned as results                         |
| Pure                                      | A programming-language design concept by which functions can not cause _side effects_.  The only result is the one a function returns           |
| Lazy                                      | A programming-language design concept by which functions and data collections are not evaluated until they are needed to complete a computation |


## Syntax basics

Nix code follows declarative principles, and as such every operation _must_ be performed as part of an assignment.

```nix
{
  my_value = (my_function 2 3);
}
```

Functions are defined via the following syntax, where `x` and `y` are attributes passed into the function.
The body of the function automatically returns the result of the function.
As you can see in the example above, functions are called by putting `( )` braces around it and its parameters.
No commas are needed to separated parameters.

```nix
{
  my_function = x: y: x + y;
}
```

The two most common datastructures are _attribute sets_ and _lists_.
Attribute sets are key-value stores.
Lists can contain different types of values and don't need to be comma separated.

```nix
rec {
  number_key = 5;
  list_key = [ number_key true "Hello" ];
}
```

The `rec` keyword allows the attribute set to reference itself.

For a more detailed breakdown of syntax, check out the [Nix language](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/language/index.html) manual section.
