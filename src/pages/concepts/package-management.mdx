*Package management* is the art of building and distributing software [packages].

[Nix] is different from package managers like [apt], [dpkg], and [yum] in several important ways:

* Nix always builds all [packages] from scratch, including the entire [closure], or dependency tree, of that package.
  But if a dependency is already present in the [Nix store][store] or in a remote cache, Nix can use that instead of rebuilding it, which means that Nix can provide [incremental builds][incremental].
* Nix has a [language]&mdash;also called *Nix*&mdash;that you can use to define your own package builds
* Nix works on several platforms, including Linux, macOS, and Windows WSL.
