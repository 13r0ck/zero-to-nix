Nix *packages* are self-contained bundles that are build using [derivations](/concepts/derivation)
and provide some kind of software or dependencies of software on your computer.
A package can have dependencies on other packages, which are encoded in its *closure*.
Each package lives at a unique pathi in the [nix store](/concepts/nix-store), indexed by its name and its input hash.
