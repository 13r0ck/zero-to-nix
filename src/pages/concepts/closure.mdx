In Nix, a [package]'s *closure* encapsulates all of the packages required to build it (as well as the packages required to build those packages, and so on).
A package can have zero packages in its closure, because no other packages are required to build it, or it can have thousands.
Whenever you build a package, you always necessarily build its entire closure.
