A *Nix channel* is a release branch for some Nix code, which follows a particular policy.
Sounds confusing?
Channels are best explained with some examples!

| Channel name           | Release date                                                                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `nixos-22.11`          | Initially release in November of 2022 and updated for 6 months afterwards    | A stable version of NixOS, released in November of 2022.  Security patches and updates will be backported, but no new applications, or breaking changes will be applied                                        |
| `nixos-unstable`       | Frequently updated, whenever a set of important packages builds on `staging` | The rolling release channel of NixOS, which is updated whenever its feasible to do so.  Security updates, new packages, and breaking changes will appear on your computer very frequently                      |
| `nixos-unstable-small` | Same as `nixos-unstable`, but more frequently                                | A rolling release channel similar to `nixos-unstable` but with a smaller set of packages that are tested.  This means this channel is updated more frequently, but may have some broken packages on it as well |

Of course way more channels than that exist.
And channels are still (somewhat) relevant, even when using Flakes, since different branches can be used as flake inputs.

```nix
{
  inputs = {
    nixpkgs-stable = "github:nixos/nixpkgs/nixos-22.11";
    nixpkgs-unstable = "gihub:nixos/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable";
  };
}
```

## The problem with `nix-channel`

The _legacy_ way to update nixpkgs and other sources is via the `nix-channel` command.
The problem with this approach is that `nix-channel` does not provide any guarantees about what inputs are actually used in a particular build.
As such source [pinning](/concepts/pinning) and [rollbacks](/concepts/rollback) are much harder with nix-channels.
