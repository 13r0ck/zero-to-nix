*Incremental builds* are build processes that don't need to rebuild the entire dependency tree of a software artifact every time

## How Nix provides incremental builds

Whenever Nix builds a [package], it builds the entire [closure], or dependency tree, of that package.

<NixStorePath pkg="git-2.27.3" />

[closure]: /concepts/closures
[package]: /concepts/packages
[store]: /concepts/nix-store
