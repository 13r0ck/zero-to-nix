Software needs to come from somewhere.
*Provenance* is where it came from.
[Nix] is really good at provenance due to [sandboxing], which ensures [reproducibility].

Nix differs from many [package managers][pkg]

[nix]: /concepts/nix
[pkg]: /concepts/package-management
[reproducibility]: /concepts/reproducibility
[sandboxing]: /concepts/sandboxing
