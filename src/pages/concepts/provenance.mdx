*Provenance* is a fancy term for where something comes from.
In software, provenance usually refers to the build process that created an artifact (a program, a file, a smartphone app, and so on).
Without establishing the provenance of a piece of software&mdash;like the code it was built from or the server it was downloaded from&mdash;it's hard to know how much you should trust that piece of software.
Is it a useful piece of software created by people you trust?
Or does it masquerade as a useful piece of software while
Establishing the provenance of that software usually answers that question.


Software needs to come from somewhere.
*Provenance* is where it came from.
[Nix] is really good at provenance due to [sandboxing], which ensures [reproducibility].

Nix differs from many [package managers][pkg]

[nix]: /concepts/nix
[pkg]: /concepts/package-management
[reproducibility]: /concepts/reproducibility
