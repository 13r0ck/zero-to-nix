In Nix, the term *system specificity* expresses the fact that all Nix [packages]


the fact that all Nix [derivations] have a `system` attribute that specifies which system the derivation is built on.
In order to realize a Nix derivation into a [package], each derivation in the package's closure needs to be supported on the target system.
So if you want to build the package `foo` on an `x86_64-linux` system, any dependency of the `foo` derivation needs to be supported on `x86_64-linux`.

To see the Nix alias for your current system, you can run this command in your terminal:

```shell
nix eval --impure --expr builtins.currentSystem
```

You should see a string like `"x86_64-linux"` or `"aarch64-darwin"`.

System specificity is essential to Nix being a truly multi-platform system.
Because all derivations&mdash;and thus all packages&mdash;are system specific, things like Nix [development environments][env] and [NixOS] configurations are also system specific.

## Cross compilation

Every Nix [derivation][derivations] requires a `system` property to be set.
If a package uses the [`stdenv.mkDerivation`][stdenv] function from the standard environment&mdash;this function is either used directly or wrapped by another function in most Nix packages and virtually all packages in [Nixpkgs]
