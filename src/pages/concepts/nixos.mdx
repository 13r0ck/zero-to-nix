*NixOS* is a [Linux] distribution built on [Nix] and in accordance with Nix's core principles.
NixOS is unique amongst distributions because it enables you to use the [Nix language][lang] to configure your operating system [delaratively][declarative] in a `configuration.nix` file.
And that configurability runs quite deep, including things like the [boot loader][boot], the [filesystem], [window managers][window], [kernel modules][kernel], services like [OpenSSH], and much more.


Everything[^1] in a NixOS system is purely configured via the Nix expression language and module system.
Instead of installing packages directly, you declaratively describe what system you would like to have, and Nix then builds and deploys this system for you.
To make this possible Nix uses its *module system* (explained below) and module abstractions.
A module is a piece of Nix code, which can be configured by a user, and then internally produces some system output.

## What is a module

A module in NixOS is a function, which accepts an attribute set and returns an attribute set of its own.
The basic anatomy of a module can be seen in the code snippet below.

```nix
{ lib, config, pkgs, ... }:
{
  imports = [];
  config = {};
  options = {};
}
```

<Admonition title="Why does my configuration.nix look different?" kind="info" id="why-configuration-nix" client:load>
When you first have a look at NixOS you will undoubtedly see a `configuration.nix` file in `/etc/nixos/`.
Furthermore, if you look at other people's NixOS configurations, you might not see this exact structure.

For one, the input set can be shortened (in the most extreme case to just `{ ... }`).
See the [Nix syntax](/concepts/nix#basic_syntax) section for details on what this does.

Additionally, there is some syntactic sugar around NixOS modules, which allow you to omit the `config` key, if your module does not declare any `options`.
As an example, these two modules are equivalent to each other.

```nix
# Module 1

{ ... }:
{
  imports = [ ./my-fish-config.nix ];
  programs.fish.enable = true;
}

# Module 2
{ ... }:
{
  imports = [ ./my-fish-config.nix ];
  config = {
    programs.fish.enable = true;
  };
}
```
</Admonition>

## How to use modules

First up, you can find modules to use and how to use them via the NixOS [module search].
Nix modules generally follow the [declarative] principle, meaning that there's no precise order that modules are executed in.
Instead, you describe the desired outcome of a system, which Nix then produces for you.

Following is an example of how to setup and configure the [nginx] web server.

```nix
{ ... }:
{
  services.nginx = {
    enable = true;
    virtualHosts."default" = {
      forceSSL = true;            # Redirect HTTP clients to an HTTPs connection
      default = true;             # Always use this host, no matter the host name
      root = /var/www/my-website; # Set the web root to serve
    };
  };
}
```

## Features

NixOS uses [Nix] as its [package manager][pkg] rather than [APT], [dpkg], or any of the other options for Linux.
Nix enables NixOS to provide a range of unique features.

### Atomic system updates

Any time you change your NixOS configuration, you can apply that configuration by running [`nixos-rebuild switch`][rebuild].
When you do this, NixOS installs or upgrades any [packages] that need to be installed or upgraded according to your system configuration.
And as is always the case with Nix, each package is built from scratch and stored in the [Nix store][store] rather than in directories like `/bin` or `/usr/bin`, as dictated by the [Filesystem Hierarchy Standard][fhs].

### Multi-user support

NixOS doesn't follow the [Filesystem Hierarchy Standard][fhs], instead using the [Nix store][store] for everything, including not just [packages] but also [derivations] and other required artifacts.
This enables NixOS to support an indefinite number of user *profiles* in an elegant way.
Two different users on the same NixOS host can use different versions of [Git], for example, because instead of users needing to share a global `git` in a location like `/usr/bin/git`, instead two different users could use `git` executables at locations like this instead:

* `/nix/store/sglc12hc6pc68w5ppn2k56n6jcpaci16-git-2.38.1/bin/git`
* `/nix/store/8nwsswymka208dpmsy09aydgffvg4bbi-git-2.38.0/bin/git`

Below is a diagram of the first path above:

<NixStorePath pkg="git-2.38.1" bin="git" />

Let's break store paths down into their constituent elements:

1. The **root path** is `/nix/store` by default.
2. The **input hash** is derived from the inputs to the [derivation][derivations] used to build the package
3. The **package name** is provided by the package creator
