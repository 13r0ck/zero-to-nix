*NixOS* is a [Linux] distribution built on [Nix] and its core principles.
Everything[^1] in a NixOS system is purely configured via the Nix expression language and module system.
Instead of installing packages directly, you declaratively describe what system you would like to have, and Nix then builds and deploys this system for you.
To make this possible Nix uses its *module system* (explained below) and module abstractions.
A module is a piece of Nix code, which can be configured by a user, and then internally produces some system output.

## What is a module

A module in NixOS is a function, which accepts an attribute set and returns an attribute set of its own.
The basic anatomy of a module can be seen in the code snippet below.

```nix
{ lib, config, pkgs, ... }:
{
  imports = [];
  config = {};
  options = {};
}
```


<Admonition title="Why does my configuration.nix look different?" type="info" id="why-harmonic" client:load>
When you first have a look at NixOS you will undoubtebly see a `configuration.nix` file in `/etc/nixos/`.
Furthermore, if you look at other people's NixOS configurations, you might not see this exact structure.

For one, the input set can be shortened (in the most extreme case to just `{ ... }`).
See the [Nix syntax](/concepts/nix#basic_syntax) section for details on what this does.

Additionaly there is some syntactic sugar around NixOS modules, which allow you to omit the `config` key, if your module does not declare any `options`.
As an example, the following two modules are equivalent to each other.

```nix
{ ... }:
{
  imports = [ ./my-fish-config.nix ];
  programs.fish.enable = true;
}
```

```nix
{ ... }:
{
  imports = [ ./my-fish-config.nix ];
  config = {
    programs.fish.enable = true;
  };
}
```
