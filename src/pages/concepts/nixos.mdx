**NixOS** is a [Linux] distribution built on [Nix] and in accordance with Nix's core principles.
NixOS is unique amongst distributions because it enables you to use the [Nix language][lang] to configure your operating system [delaratively][declarative] in a `configuration.nix` file.
And that configurability runs quite deep, including things like the [boot loader][boot], the [filesystem], [window managers][window], [kernel modules][kernel], services like [OpenSSH], and much more.

## Features

NixOS uses [Nix] as its [package manager][pkg] rather than [APT], [dpkg], or any of the other options for Linux.
Nix enables NixOS to provide a range of unique features.

### Atomic system updates

Any time you change your NixOS configuration, you can apply that configuration by running [`nixos-rebuild switch`][rebuild].
When you do this, NixOS installs or upgrades any [packages] that need to be installed or upgraded according to your system configuration.
And as is always the case with Nix, each package is built from scratch and stored in the [Nix store][store] rather than in directories like `/bin` or `/usr/bin`, as dictated by the [Filesystem Hierarchy Standard][fhs].

### Multi-user support

NixOS doesn't follow the [Filesystem Hierarchy Standard][fhs], instead using the [Nix store][store] for everything, including not just [packages] but also [derivations] and other required artifacts.
This enables NixOS to support an indefinite number of user *profiles* in an elegant way.
Two different users on the same NixOS host can use different versions of [Git], for example, because instead of users needing to share a global `git` in a location like `/usr/bin/git`, instead two different users could use `git` executables at locations like this instead:

* `/nix/store/sglc12hc6pc68w5ppn2k56n6jcpaci16-git-2.38.1/bin/git`
* `/nix/store/8nwsswymka208dpmsy09aydgffvg4bbi-git-2.38.0/bin/git`

Below is a diagram of the first path above:

<NixStorePath pkg="git-2.38.1" bin="git" />

Let's break store paths down into their constituent elements:

1. The **root path** is `/nix/store` by default.
2. The **input hash** is derived from the inputs to the [derivation][derivations] used to build the package
3. The **package name** is provided by the package creator
