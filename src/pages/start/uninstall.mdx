At the beginning of the Zero to Nix quick start, we [installed] Nix using [Nix Installer][nix-installer], an unofficial Nix installer from [Determinate Systems][ds].
If you need to uninstall Nix for any reason, you can do so with one command.

```shell
/nix/nix-installer uninstall
```

Once you've done that, you can verify that directories like `/nix` and `~/.nix-profile` have been removed from your system:

```shell
ls /nix # error
ls ~/.nix-profile # error
```
