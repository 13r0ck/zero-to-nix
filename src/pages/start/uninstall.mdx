summary: [
  "Use [Harmonic](/concepts/harmonic) to cleanly remove Nix from your system"

At the beginning of the Zero to Nix quick start, we [installed] Nix using [Harmonic], an unofficial Nix installer from [Determinate Systems][ds].
If you need to uninstall Nix for any reason, you can do so with one command.

```shell
sudo harmonic uninstall
```

<Admonition type="warning" client:load>
The `harmonic uninstall` command needs to be run as root, as in the code block above.
</Admonition>

Follow the prompts to approve the requested changes.
Some of the changes that Harmonic requests on all systems:

* Delete the directory tree under `/nix`
* Delete the [Nix] CLI tool
* Delete all Nix-specific users and groups
* Delete the Nix configuration file at `/etc/nix/nix.conf`

<SpecificSystem sys="Linux" client:load>
TODO!
</SpecificSystem>
<SpecificSystem sys="macOS" client:load>
Some changes specific to macOS:

* Delete Nix's dedicated [Apple File System][APFS] (APFS) volume
* Stop the Nix daemon's [launchctl] unit and delete the daemon

[launchctl]: https://www.launchd.info/
</SpecificSystem>

Once you've done that, you can verify that directories like `/nix` and `~/.nix-profile` have been removed from your system:

```shell
ls /nix # error
ls ~/.nix-profile # error
```
