import Language from "../../components/Language";
import Languages from "../../components/Languages";
import Shell from "../../components/Shell";
import Snippet from "../../components/Snippet";

Select your language below:

<Languages client:only />

To get set up using Nix in your <Language client:only /> project, create an empty project directory and add some
files to that directory using one of Determinate Systems' project templates:

<Shell client:only />

Now examine the contents of your directory:

```shell
ls .
```

What you should see:

```shell
flake.lock flake.nix
```

Let's go over what those files do

- The [`flake.lock`][flake.lock] file <Snippet id="pinning" show="pins" client:only /> all of your Nix
  dependencies to specific [Git revisions][rev].
- The [`flake.nix`][flake.nix] file defines the Nix <Snippet show="flake inputs" id="flake-inputs" client:only />
  that your configuration requires as well as the <Snippet show="flake outputs" id="flake-outputs" client:only />&mdash;development
  environments, packages, [NixOS] configurations, and more&mdash;that you want your Nix code to produce.
