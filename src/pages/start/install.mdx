import Harmonic from "../../components/Harmonic";
import Systems from "../../components/Systems";

The first step is to install [Harmonic]:

```shell
curl https://harmonic.dev | sh
```

## Install Nix

First, select your platform:

<Systems client:only />

With Harmonic installed, check to make sure that you can install Nix on your machine OK:

<Harmonic command="plan" client:only />

With Harmonic installed, you can now install Nix:

<Harmonic command="install" client:only />

## Verify

To verify that the Nix CLI has been installed:

```shell
nix --help
```

You should see help output that begins like this:

```shell
Name

    nix - a tool for reproducible and declarative configuration management
```
