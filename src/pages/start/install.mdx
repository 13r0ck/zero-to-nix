**Welcome**!
It's great to see that you're interested in [Nix].
In this quick start, we'll get Nix installed on your system and provide you with a small taste of Nix's feature set by accomplishing some practical things with Nix, including [creating a development environment][dev] and [building a package][build].

First, let us know which system you're working with:

<Systems client:load />

## Download the installer \{#download}

Before installing Nix, download [Harmonic], a tool from [Determinate Systems][detsys] that tailors the installation process to your system:

```shell
curl https://install.determinate.systems | sh
```

<Callout show="Why not the official Nix installer?" id="why-harmonic">
We don't dissuade you from using the [official Nix installer][official]&mdash;far from it!
But we believe that Harmonic provides a better experience for people who are new to Nix.
Unlike many tools, Nix needs to change your system in several ways to work properly, such as creating a new root volume in the `/nix` directory and configuring your shell profile.
Harmonic improves on the official Nix installer by enabling you to uninstall Nix&mdash;and undo all of the system changes that Harmonic introduces&mdash;with a single command.

See the [Uninstalling Nix][uninstall] guide to see how or the [Harmonic] concept doc for more info.
</Callout>

## Plan your installation \{#plan}

With Harmonic installed, you can *plan* your Nix installation:

<Harmonic command="plan" client:load />

This command outputs a [JSON] object called a *receipt* that details which changes the installation process will introduce.

<Info title="Multi-user mode">
The `multi` in the plan command indicates that Harmonic will install Nix in *multi-user mode* (as opposed to single-user mode).
We strongly recommend multi-user mode&mdash;and in fact Harmonic doesn't even support single-user mode&mdash;for reasons detailed in [this doc][multi].
</Info>

## Install Nix

You can now use Harmonic to install Nix:

<Harmonic command="install" client:load />

Follow the prompts to approve any necessary changes.
Once Harmonic has finished, load the Nix executable into your `PATH`:

```shell
exec $SHELL
```

Now you can verify that installation has succeeded:

```bash
nix --help
```

This should print the help output of the `nix` command.
Alternatively, you can run this command to get a friendly message appear in your terminal ðŸ™‚:

```shell
echo "Hello Nix" | nix run "github:nixos/nixpkgs#cowsay"
```

You should see this:

```shell
___________
< Hello Nix >
 -----------
        \   ^__^
         \  (oo)\_______
            (__)\       )\/\
                ||----w |
                ||     ||
```

Read on to the next section to learn what the `nix run` command just did.
