**Welcome**!
It's great to see that you're interested in [Nix].
In this [quick start][start], we'll get Nix installed on your system and provide you with a small taste of Nix's feature set by accomplishing some practical things, such as [creating a development environment][dev] and [building a package][build] using Nix.

## Installation \{#nix-installer}

To get started, we'll install Nix using [Nix Installer][nix-installer], a tool from [Determinate Systems][detsys] that tailors the installation process to your system:

```shell
curl -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
```

<Admonition title="Why aren't we using the official Nix installation script here?" type="info" id="why-nix-installer" client:load>
We believe that Nix Installer provides a smoother experience for people who are new to Nix than the [official Nix installation script][official].
Unlike many tools, Nix needs to make several bold changes to your system in order to work properly, such as creating a new root volume in the `/nix` directory, configuring your shell profile, and creating several new system users and groups.

Nix Installer improves on the official Nix installation script by enabling you to undo all of the system changes introduced by Nix Installer's installation process with a single command.
It also installs Nix with [Nix flakes][flakes] enabled, while the official installer requires you to enable flakes manually.

See the [Uninstalling Nix][uninstall] guide if you need to uninstall Nix or the [Nix Installer][nix-installer] concept doc if you'd like more background.
</Admonition>

<Admonition type="warning" title="Nix Installer is unlikely to work in containers" id="nix-installer-container">
Nix Installer makes some assumptions about your system that are unlikely to hold in a container environment.
In order to install and start the Nix daemon, for example, Nix Installer needs to have a service manager like [systemd] available, but service managers are usually superfluous in containers.
Although Nix Installer *may* work in some containerized environments&mdash;and you're welcome to try it out&mdash;we suggest using it only in desktop and [CI environments][ci].
</Admonition>

Validate the displayed plan and approve it to begin the installation.
Once Nix Installer has finished, load the Nix executable into your `PATH`:

```shell
exec $SHELL
```

Now verify that installation has succeeded:

```bash
nix --help
```

This should print the help output of the `nix` command.

**Congrats**!
You now have Nix installed and ready to go on your system.
You're now ready to use Nix to run programs.
