import Harmonic from "../../components/Harmonic";
import Systems from "../../components/Systems";

The first step is to install [Harmonic]:

```shell
curl https://harmonic.dev | sh
```

## Install Nix

First, select your platform:

<Systems client:only />

With Harmonic installed, check to make sure that you can install Nix on your machine OK:

<Harmonic command="plan" client:only />

The `multi` in the plan command indicates that Harmonic will install Nix in [multi-user
mode][multi] (as opposed to single-user mode). We recommend multi-user mode&mdash;and in fact
Harmonic doesn't even support single-user mode&mdash;because... REASONS.

With Harmonic installed, you can now install Nix:

<Harmonic command="install" client:only />

## Verify

To verify that the Nix CLI has been installed:

```shell
nix --help
```

You should see help output that begins like this:

```shell
Name

    nix - a tool for reproducible and declarative configuration management
```
