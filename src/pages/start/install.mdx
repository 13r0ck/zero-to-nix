**Welcome**!
It's great to see that you're interested in [Nix].
In this guide gets Nix installed on your system, provides you with a small taste of Nix's feature set, and gets you accomplishing practical things.
First, let us know which system you're working with:

<Systems client:load />

## Download the installer \{#download}

Before installing Nix, download [Harmonic], a tool from [Determinate Systems][detsys] that tailors the installation process to your system:

```shell
curl https://install.determinate.systems | sh
```

<Callout show="Why not the official Nix installer?" id="why-harmonic">
We don't dissuade you from using the [official Nix installer][official]&mdash;far from it!
But we believe that Harmonic provides a better experience for people who are new to Nix.
Unlike many tools, Nix needs to change your system in several ways to work properly, such as creating a new root volume in the `/nix` directory and configuring your shell profile.
Harmonic improves on the official Nix installer by enabling you to uninstall Nix with a single command.

See the [Uninstalling Nix][uninstall] guide to see how or the [Harmonic] concept doc for more info.
</Callout>

## Plan your installation \{#plan}

With Harmonic installed, you can *plan* your Nix installation:

<Harmonic command="plan" client:load />

The `multi` in the plan command indicates that Harmonic will install Nix in [multi-user
mode][multi] (as opposed to single-user mode).
We recommend multi-user mode&mdash;and in fact
Harmonic doesn't even support single-user mode&mdash;because

## Install Nix

With Harmonic installed, you can now install Nix:

<Harmonic command="install" client:load />

Once Harmonic has finished you can verify the installation:

```bash
nix --help
```

This should print the help output of the `nix` command.

Alternatively, you can run this command to get a friendly message appear in your terminal ðŸ™‚:

```
$ echo "Hello Nix" | nix run github:nixos/nixpkgs#cowsay
___________
< Hello Nix >
 -----------
        \   ^__^
         \  (oo)\_______
            (__)\       )\/\
                ||----w |
                ||     ||
```
