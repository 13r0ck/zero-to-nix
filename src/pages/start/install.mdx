**Welcome!** It's great to see that you're interested in [Nix]!
This guide explains how to install Nix on your system, followed by a short examples of running a program with Nix.
Let's get right into itâ€¦

<Systems client:only />

First, download our Nix installer <Snippet id="harmonic" show="Harmonic" client:only="react" />.
This is not yet the official installer for Nix/ NixOS, however this will probably change in the future.

```shell
curl https://harmonic.dev | sh
```

## Plan

With Harmonic installed, check to make sure that you can install Nix on your machine:

<Harmonic command="plan" client:only />

The `multi` in the plan command indicates that Harmonic will install Nix in [multi-user
mode][multi] (as opposed to single-user mode). We recommend multi-user mode&mdash;and in fact
Harmonic doesn't even support single-user mode&mdash;because... REASONS.

## Install Nix

With Harmonic installed, you can now install Nix:

<Harmonic command="install" client:only />

Once Harmonic has finished you can verify the installation:

```bash
nix --help
```

This should print the help output of the `nix` command.

Alternatively you can run this command to get a friendly message appear in your terminal ðŸ™‚:

```
$ echo "Hello Nix" | nix run github:nixos/nixpkgs#cowsay
___________
< Hello Nix >
 -----------
        \   ^__^
         \  (oo)\_______
            (__)\       )\/\
                ||----w |
                ||     ||
```

Read on to the next section to learn what this last command just did!
