**Welcome!** It's great to see that you're interested in [Nix]!
This guide explains how to install Nix on your system, followed by a short examples of running a program with Nix.
Let's get right into itâ€¦

<Systems client:load />

First, download our Nix installer [Harmonic].
This is not yet the official installer for Nix/ NixOS, however this will probably change in the future.

```shell
curl https://harmonic.dev | sh
```

Harmonic follows different steps based on the _build plan_ you select.

Currently there are only two: `linux-multi` (for 64-bit Linux systems) and `darwin-multi` (for 64-bit Intel and ARM macOS systems).
The `-multi` refers to the type of installation being performed (meaning [multi-user][multi]).

If this seems confusing, don't worry about it too much for now.
We will go into the technical side of what a Nix installation entails in the **Concepts** section of this guide.

Once Harmonic has finished you should verify the installation by running:

```bash
nix --help
```

This should print the help output of the _nix_ command.

Alternatively you can run this command to get a friendly message appear in your terminal ðŸ™‚:

```
$ echo "Hello Nix" | nix run github:nixos/nixpkgs#cowsay
___________
< Hello Nix >
 -----------
        \   ^__^
         \  (oo)\_______
            (__)\       )\/\
                ||----w |
                ||     ||
```

Read on to the next section to learn what this last command just did!
