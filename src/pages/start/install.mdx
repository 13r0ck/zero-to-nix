**Welcome**! It's great to see that you're interested in [Nix]. In this guide gets Nix installed on
your system, provides you with a small taste of Nix's feature set, and gets you accomplishing
practical things. First, let us know which system you're working with:

<Systems client:only />

## Download the installer

Before installing Nix, download <Snippet id="harmonic" show="Harmonic" client:only="react" />,
a tool from [Determinate Systems][detsys] that tailors the installation process to your system:

```shell
curl https://harmonic.dev | sh
```

## Plan

With Harmonic installed, check to make sure that you can install Nix on your machine:

<Harmonic command="plan install" client:visible />

The `multi` in the plan command indicates that Harmonic will install Nix in [multi-user
mode][multi] (as opposed to single-user mode). We recommend multi-user mode&mdash;and in fact
Harmonic doesn't even support single-user mode&mdash;because... REASONS.

With Harmonic installed, you can now install Nix:

<Harmonic command="install" client:visible />
