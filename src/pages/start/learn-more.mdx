This completes your Zero to Nix journey!
You just accomplished a great deal.
You [installed Nix][install] on your machine, you explored a [Nix development environment][env], you built a [Nix package][pkg], and more.
We're thrilled that you've taken the time and made the effort.

But we also hope, of course, that your journey with Nix continues onward.
This guide suggests some areas where you can apply your newly won Nix knowledge.

## Build containers

[Nix] can build [packages] for many things, from standard tools like [curl] and [Git] to [Vim] plugins to [Visual Studio Code][code] extensions to web services that you write in your preferred language and far beyond.
We've covered a few of these package types here in the [quick start][start].
Another powerful Nix feature is that you can use it to build [OCI]-compliant container images and thus replace tools like [Docker] and [Podman] (at least when it comes to building images).

## Configure your home environment

[Home Manager][home] is a plugin-based tool built on Nix that you can use to configure a wide range of tools in your home environment, including [Vim], [tmux], [Visual Studio Code][code], [Git], [gpg], shells like [Bash], [zsh], and [fish]
