This completes your Zero to Nix journey!
You just accomplished a great deal.
You [installed Nix][install] on your machine, you explored a [Nix development environment][env], you built a [Nix package][pkg], and more.
We're thrilled that you've taken the time and made the effort.

But we also hope, of course, that your journey with Nix continues onward.

## Build containers

[Nix] can build many things, from standard tools like [curl] and [Git] to [Vim] plugins to [Visual Studio Code][code] extension.
We've covered a few of these here in the [quick start][start].
This also includes [OCI]-compliant container images.
Nix can actually replace tools like [Docker] and [Podman].

## Use NixOS as your operating system

[NixOS]

## Configure your home environment

[Home Manager][home]

## Continuous integration
