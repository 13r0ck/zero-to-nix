title: Create a shell environment using Nix
order: 4
---

In the [last step][nix-run], we ran `cowsay` without needing to install it first.
Instead, with the `nix run` command, [Nix] installed the `cowsay` package from [Nixpkgs] and then ran the `cowsay` program.

```shell
nix shell "nixpkgs#cowsay"
```

```shell
which cowsay
```

```shell
exit
```

```shell
nix shell "nixpkgs#cowsay" "nixpkgs#hello"
```

```shell
which cowsay
which hello
```

## Running a command \{#command}

```shell
nix shell "nixpkgs#jq" "nixpkgs#curl" --command curl https://dummyjson.com/products/1 | jq .
```

## A more realistic example \{#example}

```shell
nix shell "nixpkgs#terraform" "nixpkgs#hello"
```

**Congrats**!
You've created an ephemeral shell environment using Nix.
