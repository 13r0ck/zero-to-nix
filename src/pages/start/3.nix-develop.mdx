One of Nix's key features for developing software is Nix [development environments][dev].
You can define development environments of any complexity using the [Nix language][language].
We'll cover that a bit later, but for now let's get a feel for what a Nix development environment is and how it works.

The [`nix develop`][nix-develop] command activates a Nix environment:

```shell
nix develop "github:DeterminateSystems/zero-to-nix#example"
```

<Admonition warning title="This could take a while" id="nix-develop-loading" client:load>
The first time you activate a Nix development environment using `nix develop` it's likely to be a slow operation.
That's because Nix needs to build every [package][packages] included in the environment from scratch.
This is in contrast to most [package managers][pkg], which install things more quickly because they download pre-built archives like tarballs.
Future `nix develop` invocations should be much faster, as Nix doesn't need to build the packages again.
</Admonition>

You should be greeted by a new shell prompt, something like this:

```shell
(nix:example) bash-5.1$
```

:rocket: **Success**!
You're now in a [Bash] environment that includes [curl] and [Git].
You may already have both in your environment, but run these commands to see that something new is happening:

```shell
type curl
type git
```

For curl, for example, you should see a strange path like this (the hash part should be different on your machine):

<NixStorePath pkg="curl-7.86.0-bin" bin="curl" />

What happened here? The [Nix] CLI did a few things:

* It used the `github:DeterminateSystems/zero-to-nix` [flake reference][flakes] to pull in some Nix code and drilled into a specific [flake output][output] (more on this later).
* It built the [packages] specified in the environment configuration (again, more on this later).
* It set up an environment with a [`PATH`][path] that enables the `git` and `curl` packages to be discovered in the [Nix store][store].

Two other things that you can provide in Nix development environments:

1. Although this example doesn't include one, you can define *shell hooks*, which are arbitrary shell code that runs whenever the environment starts up.
  Some example use cases for shell hooks:
  * `echo` information about the environment to the console whenever the environment is activated
  * Run things like checks and linters
  * Ensure that other desired hooks, like [Git hooks][hooks], are properly set up

  Run this to see an example shell hook:

  ```shell
  nix develop "github:DeterminateSystems/zero-to-nix#hook"
  ```

1. Nix development environments support environment variables as well. Run `echo $FUNNY_JOKE` to access a (hilarious) value that's available only in the Nix environment.
  Some example use cases for environment variables:
  * Set logging levels using `LOG_LEVEL` or whatever is appropriate for the tools you're using.
  * Set the environment using variables like `NODE_ENV` (for [Node.js]) to `development`, `dev`, and so on.

Let's leave the Nix development environment:

```shell
exit
```

If you have [Git] installed, check your `PATH` for it using `type git`.
It should be at a global path like `/usr/bin/git`.
And if you run `echo $FUNNY_JOKE` again you should get an empty string (unless you happen to have that variable set on your machine!).

## Run commands inside the development environment

While it's fun to explore the environment, you don't always want to be inside the environment to use it.
The `nix develop` command provides a `--command` (or `-c`) flag that you can use to run commands that *use* the environment but *from* your current environment.
Here are some examples for the environment we used earlier:

```shell
nix develop "github:DeterminateSystems/zero-to-nix#example" --command git help
nix develop "github:DeterminateSystems/zero-to-nix#example" --command curl https://example.com
```

In both cases, you're running a package in the [Nix store][store] and nothing from your global environment.
As you can see, Nix development environments are [*hermetic*][hermeticity] in that they're isolated from the surrounding environment (such as your environment variables and paths like `/bin` and `/usr/bin`).

## Language-specific environments

As we did in the [last section][last], let's get a bit more specific and explore how Nix can benefit more specific programming environments.
Select one of these programming languages:

<Languages client:load />

Now explore the Nix development environment for <Language client:load />:

<NixDevelop client:load />

<SpecificLanguage client:load lang="C++">
First, let's see the Nix store path for [CMake]:

```shell
type cmake
```

Check the current CMake version:

```shell
cmake --version
```
</SpecificLanguage>
<SpecificLanguage client:load lang="Haskell">
First, let's see the Nix store path for the [Glasgow Haskell Compiler][ghc] (GHC):

```shell
type ghc
```

Check the current GHC version:

```shell
ghc --version
```
</SpecificLanguage>
<SpecificLanguage client:load lang="JavaScript">
First, let's see the Nix store path for [Node.js]:

```shell
type node
```

Now use Node to run a program:

```shell
node --eval "console.log('1 + 1 = ' + (1 + 1))"
```
</SpecificLanguage>
<SpecificLanguage client:load lang="Python">
First, let's see the Nix store path for Python:

```shell
type python
```

Now use Python to run a program:

```shell
python -c "print(1 + 1)"
```
</SpecificLanguage>
<SpecificLanguage client:load lang="Go">
First, let's see the Nix store path for the [Go] CLI:

```shell
type go
```

Now check the Go version:

```shell
go version
```

You should get 1.19.3.
</SpecificLanguage>
<SpecificLanguage client:load lang="Rust">
First, let's see the Nix store path for [cargo]:

```shell
type cargo
```

Now create a [Rust] project in the current directory and run the example:

```shell
cargo init ./zero-to-nix-rs
cd ./zero-to-nix-rs
cargo run
```

You should see `Hello, world!`.
</SpecificLanguage>

Like usual, run `exit` to leave the Nix environment and return to your usual environment.

## Beyond language-specific environments

In the [previous section](#language-specific-environments), we explored Nix environments tailored to specific programming languages.
But Nix environments are infinitely flexible, enabling you to combine whichever packages you like.
Let's explore an example of this:

```shell
nix develop "github:DeterminateSystems/zero-to-nix#multi"
```

This Nix environment has several tools available:

* [Python]
* [kubectl]
* [Terraform]
* [OpenSSL]

As in the previous examples, you can run commands like `type python` and `type kubectl` to see that these tools are all discoverable in the [Nix store][store] and not somewhere like `/usr/bin`.
This list could easily include 100 packages.
It's up to you.
We won't cover *how* to create these environments just yet, but we hope that you come away from this guide with a basic sense of what Nix development environments provide.

<Admonition success open title="Nix development environments and direnv" id="nix-develop-direnv" client:load>
[direnv] is a popular tool that automatically loads specific environment variables whenever you `cd` into a directory (and then unloads those variables when you `cd` out of the directory).
The combination of direnv and Nix can be quite powerful, enabling you to automatically load Nix development environments whenever you navigate to a directory.
For more info, see [Effortless dev environments with Nix and direnv][nix-direnv] on the [Determinate Systems blog][blog].
