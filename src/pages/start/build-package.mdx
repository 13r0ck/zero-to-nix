While [Nix] can do many things, [package management] is the thing that it's perhaps best known for. In this tutorial, we'll use our [installed Nix CLI][install]

Let's start by building and running a package defined in [Nixpkgs].

## Build a package written in `$LANGUAGE`

Nix [derivations] are deeply flexible and enable you to create [packages] written in any language imaginable. In this section, we'll explore that by building and running packages for tools written in multiple languages. Select a language below to see Nix packages in action:

<Languages client:load />

<SpecificLanguage client:load lang="JavaScript">
Let's build and run [npm]:

```shell
nix build "nixpkgs#nodePackages.npm"
./result/bin/npm --help
```
</SpecificLanguage>
<SpecificLanguage client:load lang="Python">
Let's build and run [pip]:

```shell
nix build nixpkgs#pythonPackages.pip
./result/bin/pip --help
```
</SpecificLanguage>
<SpecificLanguage client:load lang="Go">
Let's build and run [kubectl]:

```shell
nix build nixpkgs#kubectl
./result/bin/kubectl --help
```
</SpecificLanguage>
<SpecificLanguage client:load lang="Rust">
Let's build and run [bat]:

```shell
nix build nixpkgs#bat
```
</SpecificLanguage>

## Build and run a package using local Nix logic

<Shell client:load />

To build the package defined in the [flake]:

```shell
nix build
```
