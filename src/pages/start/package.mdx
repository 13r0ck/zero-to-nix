Amongst other things, Nix is a **build system** that enables you to convert software inputs into
**packages** that can be distributed and deployed. We'll use Nix to build and run a package here.

To get started, initialize a new TODO:

```shell
mkdir nix-pkg && cd nix-pkg
nix flake init --template github:DeterminateSystems/zero-to-nix#pkg
```

Take a look at the imported `flake.nix`:

```nix
{
  inputs = {
    # TODO
  };

  outputs = { self, nixpkgs, flake-utils }:
    flake-utils.lib.eachDefaultSystem (system:
      let
        pkgs = import nixpkgs { inherit system; };
      in
      {
        packages.default = pkgs.mkDerivation {
          name = "mypkg";
          # TODO
        };
      });
}
```

We'll go over this flake definition in more detail in a minute. For now, let's build the `default`
package:

```shell
nix build
```

Run `ls .` and you should now have a thing called `result` in your directory. `result` is a
[symlink]. Let's see where that symlink points to:

```shell
readlink result
```

That should bring up a directory of this form:

TODO

So what has happened? Nix has built the `mypkg` package and stored it in the TODO,
which by default has its root at `/nix/store` in your filesystem.
