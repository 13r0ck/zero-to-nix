One of the virtues of the [Nix ecosystem][ecosystem].

```shell
nix flake show
```

One of the core virtues of the Nix ecosystem

[Nixpkgs] has many packages

## The `nix search` command \{#nix-search}

Let's see if [npm] is available in [Nixpkgs]:

```shell
nix search nixpkgs npm
```

<Admonition type="warning" title="This could take a while" id="nix-search" client:load>
The first time you run `nix search`, the Nix CLI needs to download the full contents of [Nixpkgs]&mdash;or whichever flake you're searching&mdash;and then cache it.
Future `nix search` runs for Nixpkgs should be much speedier.
Furthermore, Nixpkgs is the largest flake in existence and running `nix search` on other flakes should be much faster in general.
