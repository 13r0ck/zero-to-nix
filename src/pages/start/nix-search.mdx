One great thing about Nix is that there are *tons* of [packages] available in the [Nix ecosystem][ecosystem] that you can use in [Nix development environments][env].
While [Nixpkgs] is by far the largest Nix package collection&mdash;over 80,000 packages and counting&mdash;any [Nix flake][flakes] can provide packages.
In this guide, we'll learn how to search for packages in Nixpkgs using the [`nix search`][nix-search] command and the web application at [search.nixos.org][search].
Then we'll learn how to search for packages in other flakes.

## The `nix search` command \{#nix-search}

The [Nix CLI][nix] has a `search` command that you can use to search the packages in a flake based on a search term.
Let's start by searching [Nixpkgs], which is where we're mostly likely to find packages we want.
This command will tell us if [npm] is available in [Nixpkgs]:

```shell
nix search nixpkgs npm
```

Here, the `nixpkgs` [flake reference][flakes] is shorthand for `github:`

<Admonition kind="warning" title="This could take a while" id="nix-search" client:load>
The first time you run `nix search`, the Nix CLI needs to download the full Nix code contents of [Nixpkgs]&mdash;or whichever flake you're searching&mdash;and then cache it.
Future `nix search` runs for Nixpkgs should be much speedier.
Furthermore, Nixpkgs is the largest flake in existence and running `nix search` on other flakes should be much faster in general.

You can also output search results as JSON using the `--json` flag:

```shell
nix search nixpkgs cargo-edit --json
```

This can be useful if you want to parse the output using a tool like [jq].

### System specificity

One thing you'll notice about the search output is that all the packages listed in the query results are for your current system (`x86_64-linux` for an AMD/Intel Linux system, `aarch64-darwin` for an Apple Silicon system, and so on).

## search.nixos.org

The web interface at [search.nixos.org][search]

[search.nixos.org][search] has a few advantages over the [`nix search`](#nix-search-command) command:

## The `nix flake show` command \{#nix-flake-show}

The [Wayland] window system protocol.

```shell
nix flake show github:nix-community/nixpkgs-wayland
```

<Admonition kind="info" title="When to use which command" id="which-search-command" client:load>
Should you use `nix flake show` or `nix search`?
A good rule of thumb is to always use `nix search` with Nixpkgs and to initially use `nix flake show` with other flakes.
If the package outputs for `nix flake show` are big enough to be tricky to navigate, use `nix search` instead.
