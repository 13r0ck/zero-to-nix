**Welcome**!
It's great to see that you're interested in [Nix].
In this [quick start][start], we'll get Nix installed on your system and provide you with a small taste of Nix's feature set by accomplishing some practical things, such as [creating a development environment][dev] and [building a package][build] using Nix.

## Install Nix \{#up}

The best way to install Nix is to use [Nix installer][nix-installer], a tool from [Determinate Systems][detsys] that tailors the installation process to your system:

```shell
curl -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
```

<Admonition info title="Why aren't we using the official Nix installation script here?" id="why-nix-installer" client:load>
We believe that Nix Installer provides a smoother experience for people who are new to Nix than the [official Nix installation script][official].
Unlike many tools, Nix needs to make several changes to your system in order to work properly, such as creating a new `/nix` directory, configuring your shell profile, and creating several new system users and groups.

Nix Installer improves on the official Nix installation script by enabling you to undo, with a single command, all of the system changes introduced by Nix Installer's installation process.
It also installs Nix with [Nix flakes][flakes] enabled, while the official installer requires you to enable flakes manually.

See the [Uninstalling Nix][uninstall] guide if you need to uninstall Nix or the [Nix Installer][nix-installer] concept doc if you'd like more background.
</Admonition>

Validate the displayed plan and approve it to begin the installation process.
Once Nix Installer has finished, you should see `Nix was installed successfully!` in your terminal.
Then you can load the Nix executable into your `PATH`:

```shell
exec $SHELL
```

Finally, verify that installation has succeeded:

```bash
nix --version
```

This should print the version information for Nix.

:rocket: **Success**!
You now have Nix installed and ready to go on your system.
