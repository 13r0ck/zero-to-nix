[**Zero to Nix**](/) is a highly opinionated learning resource for [Nix] created by [Determinate Systems][ds]. We created Zero to Nix for four reasons:

1. We find the existing documentation for Nix and its ecosystem to be difficult to navigate for beginners. This includes sources like the [Nixpkgs manual][manual], the [official website][nix], [Nix Pills][pills], and semi-official sources like [nix.dev]. These are all great sources of information *on their own*, but together they can be quite daunting to the uninitiated.
1. We strongly believe that [flakes] are the future of Nix and that people onboarding into Nix should learn how to use them from the get-go. But flakes are currently marked as experimental feature of Nix and are thus not discussed in any of the official Nix documentation sources (with the exception of the [Wiki entry][wiki] for flakes).

These things together left us little choice but to proceed on our own outside of official channels.

## What's opinionated about Zero to Nix

First, as mentioned above, Zero to Nix is opinionated because it advocates learning and using [flakes] and treating [channels] as deprecated. But Zero to Nix also deviates from official recommendations in that it recommends installing Nix using [Harmonic] rather than the [official Nix installer][install].

There's nothing *wrong* with the official Nix installer&mdash;far from it!&mdash;and we don't dissuade you from using it. But we feel pretty strongly that Harmonic is more likely to offer a smooth experience for newcomers.
