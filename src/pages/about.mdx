[**Zero to Nix**](/) is a learning resource for [Nix] created by [Determinate Systems][ds]. We created it for two reasons:

1. We find the existing documentation for Nix and its ecosystem to be difficult to navigate for beginners. This includes sources like the [Nixpkgs manual][manual], the [official website][nix], and semi-official sources like [nix.dev].
2. We strongly believe that [flakes] are the future of Nix and that people onboarding into Nix should learn how to use them from the get-go. But flakes are currently marked as as experimental feature of Nix and are thus not discussed in any of the official Nix documentation sources (with the exception of the [Wiki entry][wiki] for flakes).

These two reasons left us little choice but to proceed on our own outside of official channels.
